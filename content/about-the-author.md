Ever consider the possibility that the biography of an author maybe doesn't matter so much? After all, to this day, we know virtually nothing about, say, Thomas Pynchon or J.D. Salinger, and it certainly worked to George Eliot's advantage that people didn't know her biography. And there's ongoing debate over whether all of Shakespeare's works were even written by the same person. And if we can't say much about the biography of Shakespeare, then why do we care about anyone else?

Let's set aside the trope of the mysterious genius author who we know little about though. More interesting that than is the notion that a great work might come from anyone or anywhere. Transcendent "outsider" work is the most unique and interesting writing there is. My book is not that. But I acknowledge a desire deep within myself that it was. As a half-measure towards that, I try hard in all my writing to keep a grip on accessibility and clarity while at the same time trying to let go of the need to conform to convention.

I would like to see the  punk-rock DIY aesthetic brought into modern writing. Along with that, I'd like to see writing judged more on its own merits than on some credential list. What is that but giving yourself over to someone else's authority? 

Worse yet, is the use of the author bio as a way to project the reader's own fantasies about what their life might be onto the author -- as a way to sell books, no less. The attractive, stylish author in the headshot on the back of the book. The "a writer living in Brooklyn" in the italicized bio blurb. The ivy league educations and the privilege of having the time in life to write a novel because someone else has paid the expenses of living. I'm putting my foot down. It has got to be stopped. It ends here. Or, since trying to stop this is a real pissing-into-the-wind move, it's just not going to continue right here.
