# FAQ

## Not really a question, more of an order: convince me to read this book.
Action packed. Fun to read.

Probably the only book you'll ever read with a pigeon and a submarine.

## What genre is it exactly?
Speculative fiction, for sure.
Not a traditional submarine novel.
Not alternate history exactly (Hitler doesn't win the war)
