# Frequently(?) Asked Questions

## What's it like, in one line?
I like to say: "like a cross between a 1970s trucker movie and a 1960s submarine movie." But that probably only appeals to a small slice of a certain kind of Gen-X dude.

More than one reader has said: "Like Serenity on a submarine." (Note: I've never seen Serenity, and only a couple of episodes of Firefly. Make of that what you will.)


## Not really a question, more of an order: convince me to read this book.
Action packed. Fun to read.

Probably the only book you'll ever read with a pigeon and a submarine.


## What genre is it exactly?
Speculative fiction, for sure.
Not a traditional submarine novel.
Not alternate history exactly (Hitler doesn't win the war)
Hard to pin down exactly.

Needs a new genre label: grimepunk?


## Can I get a sample to see if I like it?
Absolutely! Try starting here: [link to chapter... 6? stilt city? maybe directly to file on Github repo?]


## I found a mistake.
Please submit any grammatical or technical mistakes on [my contact page](https://grannycart.net/contact).
I welcome your corrections. 

For technical corrections: please explain your reasoning behind why you think I got some technical aspect wrong. Try to remember it _is_ fiction, and just a _tiny_ bit it technical leeway should be allowed, particularly if it contributes to dramatic tension. On the other hand, I really want the book to carry a _lot_ of technical/mechanical precision, because I think that _contributes_ to the dramatic tension in a way that made-up stuff (usually) does not.

If you know how to work Github, feel free to fork the project, fix it yourself, and send me a pull request.


## I love this submarine world you created and I want to spend more time there! Will there be a sequel?
I have extensive notes for a second book.
I need time to write it though.
For now, try the short story.


## Can I support your work with money?
A nice thought. But how about sending your money to [The Worker's Justice Project](http://www.workersjustice.org/) instead?

But more importantly, get someone else to read it. Julian Barnes talks about how someone, someday will be the last person to read his book. I'd be a lot happier if for my book that person was not you.

Also get on the mailing list! (Link to why you should get on mailing lists.)


## Is this book published by a legit publisher?
No. And it probably never will be. Apparently my decision to release an early version for public review severely hobbled the chances of a real publisher picking it up, and my later decision to release it under a open-content license has likely killed off any small remaining chance, since no publisher wants to sell a paper book where the author insists that the e-book version should be free.

You know what? I don't care. The vast majority of modern fiction is just terrible. And I suspect the main reason is because publishers grind up any promising good book with a commercial-potential machine until what comes out is flat garbage. Am I the only one who feels like all settings, character development, plot devices, and most themes of fiction these days seem to be constructed from building-blocks of clich√©? There's something about a lazy writer-reader relationship there, where nobody feels the need to go through the effort of developing a characters when you could just drop in a character everyone already knows from a lifetime of other media: "He was tough-looking, with a scar across his face and spoke few words." Whatever. I'm not going to get into that here. The point is, I hate most stuff that comes out of "legit" publishers, so why would I want to engage them?

This has both good an bad results. In the good column: the book is a vision of mine not mediated by someone else's need to sell copies or build buzz. In other words it's not a product. It has a DIY quality that gives it some authenticity and pathos that gets drained out of most modern books. In the bad column: there's mistakes --- always another typo --- and maybe I've given up some of the accessibility that might have come with a professional content editor shaving stuff to make it move along more quickly or shape it to make the plot the exclusive priority. I regret this somewhat. I _want_ the book to be accessible and fun to read. The world doesn't need another boring bloated literature novel where nothing happens any more than it needs another bad beach book with a plot re-hashed from some bad 80s spy thriller.

The plot of _By Sound Alone_ is simple: one submarine chases another across the oceans of the planet for some mysterious reason. Hopefully, the bit of mystery keeps you turning pages. But the goal of the book --- the way it is meant to entertain you --- is to make it feel like you are _in_ the submarine, in this world, spending your time with these characters. That's what it felt like to write it, and hopefully that's what it is like to read it too. If in some places it maybe drags a smidge because, say, you are eating a meal with the characters, then I ask you to weigh the experience of being there against a modern-style fiction novel where it's just one plot reveal after another. Not that my way is necessarily better, just different enough that I guess I'm giving up marketability --- and publishability.

Point is, I think it's a better book _because_ it's not "published." I regret the stigma "self-published" has associated with it. But _By Sound Alone_ is not really self-published either. With the advent of print-on-demand books, there's no longer any reason to print with a vanity press. _By Sound Alone_ isn't published because the idea of publishing is very last-century. It's simply _available_.
