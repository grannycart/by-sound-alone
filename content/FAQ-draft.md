# Frequently(?) Asked Questions

## Not really a question, more of an order: convince me to read this book.
Action packed. Fun to read.

Probably the only book you'll ever read with a pigeon and a submarine.


## What genre is it exactly?
Speculative fiction, for sure.
Not a traditional submarine novel.
Not alternate history exactly (Hitler doesn't win the war)
Hard to pin down exactly.

Needs a new genre label: grimepunk?


## Can I get a sample to see if I like it?
Absolutely! Try starting here: [link to chapter... 6? stilt city? maybe directly to file on Github repo?]


## I found a mistake.
Please submit any grammatical or technical mistakes on [my contact page](https://grannycart.net/contact).
I welcome your corrections. I have no editor, it's just me. Community contributions seem like a good alternative to editing.
That is also the reason the book version is "Final Beta." It is "final" because it's done, as far as I'm concerned. But it remains in "beta" until we're satisfied as a community that it is really _really_ good. With your help, I think we can make it damn near perfect.

For technical corrections: please explain your reasoning behind why you think I got some technical aspect wrong. Try to remember it _is_ fiction, and just a _tiny_ bit it technical leeway should be allowed, particularly if it contributes to dramatic tension. On the other hand, I really want the book to carry a _lot_ of technical/mechanical precision, because I think that _contributes_ to the dramatic tension in a way that made-up stuff (usually) does not.

If you know how to work Github, feel free to fork the project, fix it yourself, and send me a pull request.


## I love this submarine world you created and I want to spend more time there! Will there be a sequel?
I have extensive notes for a second book.
I need time to write it though.
For now, try the short story.


## Can I support your work with money or coffee?
Yes, obviously. Probably the simplest thing is to just buy a copy on Barnes & Noble when it becomes available there.

But more importantly, get someone else to read it. Julian Barnes talks about how someone, someday will be the last person to read his book. I'd be a lot happier if for my book that person was not you.

Also get on the mailing list! (Link to why you should get on mailing lists.)


## Is this book free? What license is it released under?
See the [LICENCE.txt](../LICENCE.txt) file.
