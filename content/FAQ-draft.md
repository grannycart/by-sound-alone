# FAQ


## Not really a question, more of an order: convince me to read this book.
Action packed. Fun to read.

Probably the only book you'll ever read with a pigeon and a submarine.


## What genre is it exactly?
Speculative fiction, for sure.
Not a traditional submarine novel.
Not alternate history exactly (Hitler doesn't win the war)
Hard to pin down exactly.

Needs a new genre label: grimepunk?


## Can I get a sample to see if I like it?
Absolutely! Try starting here: [link to chapter... 6? stilt city? maybe directly to file on github repo?]


## Book 1? Will there be a Book 2?
I have extensive notes for a second book.
I need time to write it though.


## Can I support your work with money or coffee?
Yes, obviously. Probably the simplest thing is to just buy a copy on (ugh) Amazon when it becomes available there.

But more importantly, get someone else to read it. Julian Barnes talks about how someone, someday will be the last person to read his book. I'd be a lot happier if for my book that person was not you.

Also get on the mailing list! (Link to why you should get on mailing lists.)


## What license is the work under? Is it open?
The current pre-release version of the book is under an open-content Creative Commons license.
If I have any say in the matter, it will always remain that way.

But... If some publisher offered me the services of a professional editor, promotion, and an advance on a second book, and all I had to do was lock down the copyright on the final published version of the book, I'll be honest with you: watch how fast I will sell out!

I'm committed to open content and a strong public domain. I have benefitted most of my life from the generocity of the open-source community. And ideally wherever this book goes in the future I would be happiest if it retained an "open-source" status in one way or another. I also have no illusions or daydreams about making tons of money on some book deal and becoming a lazy-famous author. That illusion is both impractictal and unlikely. Also I just don't care about money. What I care about is _time_.

While I can get writing done while holding down a full time day job, I find I can't get my _best_ writing done. I could and would live on a very small amount of money if I had the option to spend the biggest chunk of my day --- and the best hours of my day --- writing. But currently I have approximately no income from these projects, and a day job that occupies, well, my day. Focusing on writing isn't even an option. It's something I have to squeeze in to the tired hours of my life. I would happily negotiate my open-source values for a chance to center my time on writing.
