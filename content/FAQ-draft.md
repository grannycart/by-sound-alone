# Frequently(?) Asked Questions

## What's it like, in one line?
I like to say: "like 1970s trucker culture crossed with a 1960s submarine movie." But that probably only appeals to a small slice of a certain kind of Gen-X dude.

More than one reader has said: "Like Serenity on a submarine." (Note: I've never seen Serenity, and only a couple of episodes of Firefly. Make of that what you will.)


## Not really a question, more of an order: convince me to read this book.
Action packed. Fun to read.

Probably the only book you'll ever read with a pigeon and a submarine.


## What genre is it exactly?
Speculative fiction, for sure.
Not a traditional submarine novel.
Not alternate history exactly (Hitler doesn't win the war).
Hard to pin down precisely.

Needs a new genre label: grimepunk?


## Can I get a sample to see if I like it?
Absolutely! Try starting here: [link to chapter... 6? stilt city? maybe directly to file on Github repo? Or dig out chap 1 sample for B&N from trash?]


## If the submarine in the book was real, what year would it be from? Or, when would the technology in the book have been used in real life?
Technology-wise, the book is set in the mid-20th Century. Submarine technology hit a sweet spot around then. They were efficient underwater and achieving impressive technological feats, but still had diesel engines and required time on the surface to recharge. WWII subs were basically surface ships that had the ability to submerge, but limited to only a few hundred feet of depth. Nuclear subs, on the other end of the spectrum, rarely have to surface and, in terms of technology, are essentially magic.


## Can you tell me more about the "world" this story takes place in?
No. If I wanted to tell stories about the endless give and take of global powers, I would have been a journalist. The characters in the story don't care too much about politics on the surface and neither should you. In recent decades, the study of history has turned away from looking at the machinations of nation-states and instead focuses on peoples and processes. I like to think this story has a similar relationship to the world it exists in.


## I found a mistake.
Please submit any grammatical or technical mistakes on [my contact page](https://grannycart.net/contact).
I welcome your corrections. 

For technical corrections: please explain your reasoning behind why you think I got some technical aspect wrong, and cite sources where appropriate. Technical aspects of the book should conform to the limits of mid-20th Century technology (so I do not care what the capabilities of modern subs are, and while I would love to hear a story about your grandfather's experience on a WWII sub, the technical limitations he may have experienced are too old to be relevant). 

A good technical correction would be pointing out a spot where the story violates the laws of physics (no citation required). Another example would be identifying a place where a submarine performs a maneuver that would be unlikely or impossible for a sub of the time (exceeding depth limit, say), and you include a citation of the specs of a specific submarine that existed in real life. (US Submarines Since 1945 is a good reference, if you can find a copy. It was a primary source for much of the information in the book. The hull shape of the _Prospect_ was based on the second USS Tang (SS-563), albeit heavily modified.)

Try to remember it _is_ fiction, and just a _tiny_ bit it technical leeway should be allowed, particularly if it contributes to dramatic tension. On the other hand, I really want the book to carry a _lot_ of technical/mechanical precision, because I think that _contributes_ to the dramatic tension in a way that made-up stuff (usually) does not.

If you know how to use Github, feel free to fork the project, fix it yourself, and send me a pull request.


## I love this submarine world you created and I want to spend more time there! Will there be a sequel?
I have extensive notes for a second book.
I need time to write it though.
For now, try the short story [link].


## Can I support your work with money?
A nice thought, thanks! But I am committed to keeping this book free.

Instead, see: [Three things to do if you enjoy this book](what-to-do-if-you-enjoyed-the-book).


## Is this book published by a legit publisher?
No. And it probably never will be. Apparently my decision to release an early version for public review severely hobbled the chances of a real publisher picking it up, and my later decision to release it under a open-content license has likely killed off any small remaining chance, since no publisher wants to sell a paper book where the author insists that the e-book version should be free.

You know what? I don't care. Modern fiction is just terrible. And I suspect the main reason is because publishers grind up any promising good book with a commercial-potential machine until what comes out is flat garbage. (Not _all_ books, of course, but I'd say the vast majority of "successful" books could be described this way.)

Swearing off traditional book publishing has both good an bad results. In the good column: the book is a vision of mine not mediated by someone else's need to sell copies or build buzz. In other words it's not a product. It has a DIY quality that gives it some authenticity and pathos that gets drained out of most modern books. In the bad column: there's mistakes --- always another typo --- and maybe I've given up some of the accessibility that might have come with a professional content editor shaving stuff to make it move along more quickly or shape it to make the plot the exclusive priority. I regret this somewhat. I _want_ the book to be accessible and fun to read. The world doesn't need another boring bloated literature novel where nothing happens any more than it needs another bad beach book with a plot re-hashed from some bad 80s spy thriller.

The plot of _By Sound Alone_ is simple: one submarine chases another across the oceans of the planet for some mysterious reason. Hopefully, the bit of mystery keeps you turning pages. But the goal of the book --- the way it is meant to entertain you --- is to make it feel like you are _in_ the submarine, in this world, spending your time with these characters. That's what it felt like to write it, and hopefully that's what it is like to read it too. If in some places it maybe drags a smidge because, say, you are eating a meal with the characters, then I ask you to weigh the experience of being there against a modern-style fiction novel where it's just one plot reveal after another. Not that my way is necessarily better, just different enough that I guess I'm giving up marketability --- and publishability.

Point is, I think it's a better book _because_ it's not "published." I regret the stigma "self-published" has associated with it. But _By Sound Alone_ is not really self-published either. With the advent of print-on-demand books, there's no longer any reason to print with a vanity press. _By Sound Alone_ isn't published because the very idea of publishing is so last-century. The final product is not an e-book file or a print-on-demand paper book. The final product is the [git repository](https://github.com/grannycart/by-sound-alone_source/). The book is "published" only on Github. That repo contains not just all you need to make your own copy of the book in any format you like, but also a record of the entire _process_ of making the book: every plot-plan, every note, every edit, every in-line comment, every cover mockup. It is the canonical final edition. (And I reserve the right that just because it's the "final" edition doesn't mean I won't continue to fix or change things.) Everything else is essentially a reprint. What I mean by that is that if you want to delete your e-book file when you are done, or use your paper copy as kindling, I don't mind. (OK, ideally I'd prefer you gave your copy to someone else to read. But hey, if you're cold, go ahead and start a fire.) The point is that the copies are essentially worthless. What's important is that the Git repo remains available.

In the near future all books will be made with a process like this. (If not with Git, then with some type of version control at least.) But, unless the cultural values of authors and readers shift radically, you probably will only have access to the worthless copies, not to the original archive of the work being created. Even though technology makes it so it would basically cost nothing for authors to embrace transparency and let readers see their process, authors are still more likely to want to keep the process closed and pipe their final product through an increasingly-irrelevant publishing industry. Capitalism doesn't slip away easily.

Anyway, _this_ book will remain available in both its final form and with the entire process in place. Maybe nobody cares. Maybe someday someone will want to pick all those git commits apart to see how the book came together. Doesn't really matter. The process is included because it's just so _easy_ for it to be there.
