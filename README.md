# By Sound Alone
* A novel with submarines. And a pigeon. [bysoundalone.net](bysoundalone.net)

## This repo:
* Contains the github pages source for the novel _By Sound Alone_

### Notes on site formatting:
* Add ```goat_counter: "bysoundalone"``` to yaml at top of individual pages and they will track in goatcounter
* To count downloads, I added an html redirect page (according to instructions here: https://theorangeone.net/posts/redirecting-static-pages/) for each book format type (content/pdf-download.html, etc)
    * Each of those download redirect pages includes a java script call to goatcounter, see: https://www.goatcounter.com/help/start
* CNAME file is required for custom domain by github
