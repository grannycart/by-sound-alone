A few technical submarine people have pointed out that the leak in the first chapter occurs too slowly --- if the boat is sinking so fast they have to blow the tanks and it's still sinking, then the leak is too significant to be occurring slowly and there should be a panicked attempt to repair the sub quickly. I suspect this is correct in the most mechanically accurate sense, and it kinda kills me that I got this wrong because it's important to me that the action is driven by realistic physics and mechanics.

Still, I'm going to try to retcon it here (is it a 'retcon' if you are trying to retroactively correct a technical issue? Is this actually a 'retfix' or 'retmech' or 'rettech'?) I'm going to argue two things are possible that could leave this scenario in at least the realm of plausibility:
1. Let's assume that it is possible the leak is in a narrow range where it's bad enough to start sinking the boat, but not so bad enough that water is gushing in.
2. The two biggest differences between IRL war subs and the cargo subs in the book are: One, the cargo sub has a tiny crew complement. Two, it has a huge cargo void. Both of these things can be seen to have affected the scenario in the opening chapter: With a giant void and a small crew, it's possible for a huge amount of water to leak into the boat slowly enough that the crew doesn't notice. (Whereas on a war sub, there is no compartment without people in it, and the compartments are small enough that even a small amount of water would come up very quickly.)   

Or, what about this: the Prospect has saddle tanks. The ramming sub would have hit, and potentially badly damaged a saddle tank, and thus creating the conditions where the sub could have trouble regaining the surface, but only has cracked leaks inside the pressure hull.


I wanted to open the book by stealing this bit of drama from many (many) Deadliest Catch episodes and a few Patrick O'Brian stories where it slowly dawns on a captain that the ship has a leak and taking on water is affecting its handling. This, followed by a panic as they run around trying to figure out where the leak is coming from. I just love that slow-burn build-up to a desperate repair!
