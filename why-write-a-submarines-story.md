# Why write (or read, or watch) a Subarmine Story?

* staring at dials
	* China Syndrome: not a submarine story, but could be.
	* Where characters are watching their fate read out from nothing but a small needle on a dial
	* This scene exactly is the climax of Das Boot
* a theater piece:
	* The submarine is, by it's very nature, a set
	* It would be fun to imagine a play that is entirely set inside a sub
	* Maybe with a rotation of only three sets: the control room, the engine room, and the torpedo room
	* There is something appealing about being restricted to that stage
		* (Though Tom Clancy couldn't manage it: at the climax of _Hunt for Red October_ he was switching back and forth from one sub to another almost paragraph to paragraph)
* dragons:
	* Are elements of chaos. They ruin stories. Because _anything_ can happen.
		* (examples, maybe admit Pete's Dragon and How to Train Dragon as counter-examples) 
	* Submarines are the opposite of that. They follow a clear set of rules, most of which the audience already knows.
		* (You can't go too deep, limited air, detect enemies by sound, etc)
	* Based on the fact that three sub stories I knew best: Hunt, Crimson tide, Das boot, were all so good.
	* This set me watching all manner of submarine movies, let me tell you they are NOT all good.
* Submarine as the subconcious object (see beginning of typed short story draft)
* Most submarine stories belong to a certain kind of post-war nationalistic genre.
	* But I think there's a real opportunity to centerfuge out what's good about submarine movies, pair them with some more up-to-date notions (like, you know, female characters) and maybe create something really special.
