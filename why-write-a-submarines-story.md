# Why write (or read, or watch) a Submarine Story?

## elements
* staring at dials
	* China Syndrome: not a submarine story, but could be.
	* Where characters are watching their fate read out from nothing but a small needle on a dial
	* This scene exactly is the climax of Das Boot
* a theater piece:
	* The first thing someone who knows nothing about submarines needs to know is: they have no windows.
		* (research subs do, of course, but military-industrial subs don't.)
		* They don't need them. They interact more effectively with the outside world through other senses than vision.
		* Submarine as the subconscious object (see beginning of typed short story draft)
		* (Or that the submarine is like some kind of animal or being itself. The people operating it are like a nerve-center or brain, making decisions based on the senses that come in to them from the outside, mediated by the electro-magnetic spectrum and the capabilities of their sensors to read it.)
	* The submarine is, by it's very nature, a set
	* It would be fun to imagine a play that is entirely set inside a sub
	* Maybe with a rotation of only three sets: the control room, the engine room, and the torpedo room
	* There is something appealing about being restricted to that stage
		* (Though Tom Clancy couldn't manage it: at the climax of _Hunt for Red October_ he was switching back and forth from one sub to another almost paragraph to paragraph)
* dragons:
	* Are elements of chaos. They ruin stories. Because _anything_ can happen.
		* (examples, maybe admit Pete's Dragon and How to Train Dragon as counter-examples) 
		* (Can you get to submarines without going through dragons? They are too far off course, I think.)
	* Submarines are the opposite of that. They follow a clear set of rules, most of which the audience already knows.
		* (You can't go too deep, limited air, detect enemies by sound, etc)
	* Based on the fact that three sub stories I knew best: Hunt, Crimson tide, Das Boot, were all so good.
	* This set me watching all manner of submarine movies, let me tell you they are NOT all good.
* Most submarine stories belong to a certain kind of post-war nationalistic genre.
	* They feel dated and smell of naphthalene or camphor.
	* But I think there's a real opportunity to centerfuge out what's good about submarine movies, pair them with some more up-to-date notions (like, you know, female characters) and maybe create something really special. 
* also move into this stuff?
	* grime?
	* mechanical tech?
		* Modern subs suffer from the same story-telling-killing problem that all modern technology has: they are so complex almost _anything_ is believable
			* (list some real technology modern subs have)
			* (In many ways the idea of a subconscious object fits best here.)
			* The technology is essentially magical. Harry Potter aside, it becomes difficult to tell a compelling story when virtually anything could happen or be believed.
			* older subs = the height of mechanical technology
* (does this become an even longer preface?)
	* (or is this a manifesto of sorts?) 


## draft

There's a scene early in _The China Syndrome_ where Jack Lemon is in the control room for a nuclear reactor power plant. He stares intently at the array of dials in front of him. Not being nuclear engineers, we don't know what any of the dials are indicating exactly. But from the sweat on his brow and the tears in his eyes, we know that Jack Lemon's character is watching the nuclear reactor he is responsible for go through the early stages of a meltdown. It is a tremendous piece of acting. And it is a masterful bit of storytelling: the movie never bothers to show you the nuclear reactor itself. The drama of what is happening is entirely conveyed by a few bits of dialog and the reaction on Jack Lemon's face to what he is seeing on the dials.

It occurred to me that a person reading their fate from a wall of gauges is a singularly powerful way to convey dramatic tension to an audience. It has long been a truism of the horror film genre that the scariest thing is the thing you don't see. Once the ghost, ax murderer, face-sucking alien, or sea monster has been shown to be real the fear is shortly thereafter drained out of it. One of the things that is magic about that scene in _The China Syndrome_ is that the source of the terror, fear, and doom is held at a distance and remains unseen. At the same time the reality of it is front and center. It manages to be an invisible terror and at the same time something that is _currently_ happening --- not some vague threat, but invisible, terrifying disaster in occurring in real time. What could be more terrifying than that?

The staring-at-the-dial-in-terror scene in _The China Syndrome_ depends entirely on Jack Lemon's acting ability to convey the terror of the situation. The audience is assumed to know nothing about how nuclear reactors work, or what the dial Jack Lemon is staring at conveys. You could imagine that the effectiveness of the scene could only be enhanced if the audience understood the meaning of the readout on the dial. 

And this is precisely what happens at the climax of the greatest submarine movie of them all: _Das Boot_. The audience --- fully aware of the most basic rule of submarine drama that the boat can only go so deep before it collapses on itself from the pressure of the water --- is treated to the excitement and terror of watching the submarine sink. The knowledge of the sinking is transmitted by nothing more than the camera showing us the needle on the depth gauge climbing and climbing, until it passes the last of the hashes on the deepest part of the dial... and keeps going.

Yes, we get the cutaway shots of the captain staring in terror at the depth gauge. Yes, there are some external shots of the boat going down into the murky Mediterranean. And yes, those familiar with the scene will remember that the glass of the dial even cracks dramatically (presumably from the stress of the hull being reshaped by the pressure of the water, and thereby bending the housing of the gauge until the glass can no longer take it). But all that is just bonus. The real story is told by the depth gauge itself. One could imagine a dramatic story told by nothing _but_ gauges and dials.

For someone who is unfamiliar with the technical workings of submarines, the first thing they need to learn is that submarines have no windows. Well, _research_ submarines have windows for looking at at the strange dwellers in the deepest blackest pits of the ocean. But the submarine technology the militaries of the world developed in the 20th Century are a different kind of machine entirely. Windows are not necessary, because the boat is operated entirely by sensors that detect the world around it. The most important of those sensors uses sound waves to map the world around the submarine. It is known as sonar. In the black waters of the ocean, sound give a much clearer picture of what surrounds the submarine than vision ever could.

The sound sensors are wired up to the "control room" of the submarine. In the control room are the people who are using the sound-sensor information to decide what they want to do with their vessel and where they want to go.
