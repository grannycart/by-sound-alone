* Not ready to commit to a whole book yet? Here's a short story I'm working on that is set in the same universe, still with plenty of submarine action:

## More information:
Above you can read a complete (118k+ words, 400+ pages) novel
for free. It's about submarines. Not nuclear submarines, or modern
submarines, or any kind of submarine that actually existed. It is about
_cargo_ submarines. In a mid-century Earth where, due to the economic
circumstances of the world having skewed off slightly from the path
followed in real life, submarines ended up being recruited to do the
trucking of cargo around the world. So: not exactly like other submarine
stories you may have encountered. (Also, far more women are involved
than the typical submarine story.)

### What's it like? 

Fundamentally, it's a cross between a 1960s submarine movie and a 1970s
trucker movie. It's kind of a slurry of _Das Boot_, _Road Warrior_,
_Deadliest Catch_, and _Smokey and the Bandit_. Maybe with some _China
Syndrome_ and _Jaws_ thrown in. (Though the latter's similarity is in
tone only --- there's no sharks in the book. Sorry.) It is undoubtedly
speculative fiction --- but not _science_ fiction. What more specific
genre beyond that is maybe a little fuzzy. But it is also an action-packed
page-turner! It should be entertaining to read. If you find this isn't
the case, you should probably let me know.

More detailed FAQ on its way!
