title: A Novel With Some Submarines In It (pre-release version)
---

## Some Information:
* Read it as a really-long, unformatted webpage: [Manuscript Draft --- A Novel With Some Submarines In It (pre-release version)](content/Subworldbook1.html) by Mark Torrey
* Reference diagrams of the protagonist submarines in the novel: [Submarine diagrams](content/draft-layout_sub-diagrams.pdf) 
	* Extremely helpful for orientation during the book. Keep the diagrams handy!
	* (Note that the diagrams currently need a number of adjustments to be in full alignment with the book though.)
* "Source code" for the novel (it's just markdown): [source code](http://github.com/grannycart/subworld-book1/)
	* Compile your own e-reader (epub) or pdf file to read!

Above you can read a complete draft of a novel for free. It's about
submarines. Not nuclear submarines, or modern submarines, or any kind
of submarine that actually existed. It is about _cargo_ submarines. In
a mid-century Earth where, due to the economic circumstances of the
world having skewed off slightly from the path followed in real life,
submarines ended up being recruited to do the trucking of cargo 
around the world. So not exactly like other submarine stories you may
have encountered. (Also, far more women are involved than the typical
submarine story.)

What's it like? 

It's kind of a slurry of _Das Boot_, _Road Warrior_, _Deadliest Catch_, and
_Smokey and the Bandit_. Maybe with some _China Syndrome_ and _Jaws_ thrown
in. (Though the latter's similarity is in theme only --- there's no
sharks in the book. Sorry.) It is undoubtedly speculative fiction,
though what more specific genre than that is maybe a little fuzzy. It is
also an action-packed page-turner! It should be entertaining to read. If
you find this isn't the case, you should probably let me know.

In its current state it is a complete novel, though a pre-release
draft. What does that mean? It is a whole story, and has been wholly
edited by the author (me) but not an editor. Take from that what you
will. There may be (almost certainly are) some spelling and grammar
errors that need fixing, and maybe some parts that should be cut or
moved around. But there should be no part where you are wondering to
yourself "wait, what the fuck is going on here?" If you find yourself
asking that, you should probably let me know.

Since this is a pre-release, if you do read it, or even part
of it, I would appreciate your feedback. If you don't know how to
contact me through github, just email me: grannycart@protonmail.com.

The book is currently lacking a title. 
Suggestions welcome!
