## Some Information
This is a pre-release of a complete draft of a novel. It is about
submarines. Not nuclear submarines, or modern submarines, or any kind
of submarine that actually existed. It is about cargo submarines.
In a mid-century Earth where, due to the economic circumstances of the
world having skewed off slightly from the path followed in real life,
submarines ended up being recruited to do the trucking of cargo in
around the world.

Thus this novel became something that is part Das Boot, part Road
Warrior, part Deadliest Catch, and part Smokey and the Bandit. So it
is a novel that I had always wished existed. Maybe you do too.

Currently it is a complete story, but unedited. There are a lot of
typos, grammar, and style things remaining to be fixed. It is complete
enough to be readable and enjoyable though. Since this is a pre-release
version, if you _do_ read it, or even part of it, I would appreciate your
feedback. If you don't know how to contact me through github, just email
me: mortrye@gmail.com.

The book is currently lacking a title. 
Suggestions welcome!

The preface is only a very rough unedited draft. Don't be discouraged
by its incoherency --- the book is complete, even if the preface is not
yet so. There are many revisions I want to make to the diagrams too.
The most important thing they are lacking right now is titles! The sub
in the top diagram is the _Prospect_ the sub in the 2nd diagram is the
_Gnat_.

See the associated github repo for licensing information and development
details, or if you want to compile an epub or pdf version for yourself.
