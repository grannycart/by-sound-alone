[//]: # (Removed this bullet 2024-01-13: Not ready to commit to a whole book yet? Here's a short story I'm working on that is set in the same universe, still with plenty of submarine action: Untitled Short Story 13k wordscontent/untitled-submarine-short-story.md)

### More information:
Above you can read a complete novel (118k+ words, 380+ pages). It
is entirely free, released under a Creative Commons open-content
non-commercial license. It's about submarines. Not nuclear submarines,
or modern submarines, or any kind of submarine that actually existed.
It is about _cargo_ submarines.

### Give me the back-of-the-book blurb
In a slightly skewed-off timeline of mid-20th-century Earth, the
surface of the ocean has become a contested place. International
shipping is forced undersea, carried out by subs fitted for transporting
cargo. Captain Sylvia Percy and her small crew run one such boat, the
_Prospect_. They fight a daily battle to keep their rusting submarine
from dropping into the depths. It's just another grimy job until they
find themselves pursued by a military sub driven by some inexplicable
violent purpose. To survive, the crew of the Prospect push the machine
that is their home to the very edge of its capabilities, while still
trying to make their delivery on time.

### What's it like? 
Fundamentally, it's a mashup of 1970s trucker culture and 1960s
submarine movies. In broader terms, it's kind of a slurry of _Das Boot_,
_Road Warrior_, _Deadliest Catch_, _Smokey and the Bandit_, Mot√∂rhead,
and Bikini Kill.

It is undoubtedly speculative fiction --- but not _science_ fiction.
The story is driven by heavily-researched realistic mid-century
submarine mechanics, and framed by the confined spaces and dangerous
operations that have always been at the heart of good submarine tales.
The speculative fiction part takes our protagonist submarines from an
underwater docking bay for the transshipping of cargo, to a city built
on pylons out over the ocean, to a garbage gyre of ghost ships.

What more specific genre that it might belong to beyond "speculative
fiction" is a little fuzzy, maybe "grimepunk" if that's a thing?

But rest assured, whatever genre it is, it is also a page-turner full of
exciting submarine action! (At least after you get past the first few pages.)
