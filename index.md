[//]: # (Removed this bullet 2024-01-13: Not ready to commit to a whole book yet? Here's a short story I'm working on that is set in the same universe, still with plenty of submarine action: Untitled Short Story 13k wordscontent/untitled-submarine-short-story.md)

## More information:
Above you can read a complete (118k+ words, 400+ pages) novel
for free. It's about submarines. Not nuclear submarines, or modern
submarines, or any kind of submarine that actually existed. It is about
_cargo_ submarines. In a mid-century Earth where, due to the economic
circumstances of the world having skewed off slightly from the path
followed in real life, submarines ended up being recruited to do the
trucking of cargo around the world. So: not exactly like other submarine
stories you may have encountered. (Also, far more women are involved
than the typical submarine story.)

### What's it like? 

Fundamentally, it's a cross between a 1960s submarine movie and a 1970s
trucker movie. It's kind of a slurry of _Das Boot_, _Road Warrior_,
_Deadliest Catch_, and _Smokey and the Bandit_. Maybe with some _China
Syndrome_ and _Jaws_ thrown in. (Though the latter's similarity is in
tone only --- there's no sharks in the book. Sorry.) It is undoubtedly
speculative fiction --- but not _science_ fiction. What more specific
genre beyond that is maybe a little fuzzy. But it is also an action-packed
page-turner! It should be entertaining to read. If you find this isn't
the case, you should probably let me know.

[//]: # (Should What's it like be more like the back cover text? The surface of the ocean has become a contested place. International shipping is forced undersea, carried out by submarines fitted for transporting cargo. Captain Sylvia Percy and her small crew run one such boat, the Prospect. They fight a daily battle to keep their rusting sub from dropping into the depths. It's just another grimy job until they find themselves pursued by a military submarine driven by some inexplicable violent purpose. To survive, the crew of the Prospect push the machine that is their home to the very edge of its capabilities, while still trying to make their delivery on time. With a heritage that is equal parts 1960s submarine movie and 1970s trucker movie, By Sound Alone revels in the power of confined spaces and the dangerous operations that have always been the meat of compelling submarine stories. But it also breaks new ground with a setting of a fictional world where submarines are a critical part of global logistics networks. Derived from science fiction themes but never deviating from a commitment to realistic mid-century submarine mechanics and operations, this story propels a page-turner of a plot through a cinematic environment from which you will not want to surface.)
